- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m ITAutomator, an independent IT consultant. I have developed several programs (primarily in PowerShell) that have helped me automate many tasks. I am happy to share them here and help out others.
- ðŸ‘€ My target audience will mostly be managed service providers (MSPs) in Microsoft 365 environments who want to automate their infrastructure. 
This leads to standards-based setups, easier deployments, and manageability. These scripts will also help tinkerers and others who want to understand how these tools work.
- :soon: Currently, I am working on a much larger program to automate Intune packaging and distribution: www.appjuggler.com (available soon).
- ðŸ“« I also run https://www.itautomator.com/ which is my blog where you can subscribe and get notified when I release new stuff.
